Welcome to the WiDSAI Python Workshop! Please follow the steps below to create a copy of the our Python Workshop notebook and start editing your own copy.
Steps to Create a Copy and Edit the Notebook:

    Access the Notebook:
        Copy and paste the following link to open the Google Colab notebook:
        https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dF7hj7BjNH5RWcGKskdJRYkkdq8WDDiL?usp=sharing

    Make a Copy of the Notebook:
        Once the notebook is open, go to the File menu at the top left of the Colab interface.
        Select Save a copy in Drive from the dropdown menu.
            This will create a copy of the notebook in your own Google Drive that you can edit.

    Edit Your Copy:
        Now that you have a copy of the notebook, you can freely make any changes, working through the workshop notebook at your own pace.
        All changes you make will be saved automatically to your copy in Google Drive.

        If you'd like to share your edited copy with others, click the Share button in the top-right corner.
        Set the sharing permissions according to your preference (e.g., share with specific people or make it public).

Additional Information:

    The notebook is hosted on Google Colab, a free cloud-based platform for running Python code. You do not need any special setup or installation to use it.
    If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to the creator of this notebook.

Happy coding!
